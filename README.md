# Live-Stock-Tracker
This project uses the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve real-time stock data and display the latest close price for a specified stock. The project is written in Python, and makes use of the requests library to send API requests and the json library to parse the API's JSON response. 
## Working:
* The project begins by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the API request by providing the API keyand the stock's ticker symbol. 
* The API request is sent and the response is parsed. The project then extracts the latest close price for the stock from the API's response. The Alpha Vantage API provides a wide range of financial data and this project can be extended to display more data or to update the displayed data in real-time. 
* This project would be useful for individuals or organizations that need to monitor stock prices in real-time, such as stock traders or portfolio managers. It's also a great way to learn how to interact with APIs, parsing andmanipulating JSON data and build simple but useful scripts.
